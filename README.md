# Responsive Framework for Email
The Responsive Framework is a set of HTML guidelines that was designed through years of industry experience. It captures practices that help design responsive cross-client emails with minimal effort.

[This page](https://selligentmarketingcloud.github.io/ResponsiveFramework/) shows how different clients render [the source html of the framework](https://github.com/SelligentMarketingCloud/ResponsiveFramework/blob/main/source/v5.0.html). Note that the goal of the Responsive Framework is not to be W3C compliant, but to be email client safe.

This code is currently mainly focused for **Source Mode**. To be able to be used in **Content Blocks**, instead of using the "m_wrapper" to contain everything it will be necessary to use it in every Content Block.

Here an example of how it should look the Content Block:

```
<!-- :: Add SL into aria-label tag -->
<div role="article" aria-roledescription="email" aria-label="" lang="en" style="background-color:#d0d5d6;" class="m_wrapper darkBg">
    <!--[if (gte mso 9)|(IE)]>
    <table width="600" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" bgcolor="#ffffff" style="width:600px;" role="presentation" class="darkInner">
        <tr>
            <td align="center" width="600" style="width:600px;">
                <![endif]-->
                <div style="max-width:600px; margin:0 auto; font-size:16px; background-color:#ffffff;" class="darkInner">

                    <!-- Insert here code for Contet Block -->

                </div>
            <!--[if (gte mso 9)|(IE)]>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <![endif]-->    
</div>
```
